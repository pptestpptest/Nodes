    /// only after the dismissal is complete, detaches the child `Flow` instance using the
    /// ``AbstractFlow/detach(ending:)`` method.
    ///
    /// However, in some cases, user interactions can directly cause ``ViewControllable`` instances to be dismissed,
    /// for example when interacting with [`UINavigationController`](
    /// https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uinavigationcontroller
    /// ) (from `UIKit`). By long pressing the back button of the navigation controller, a user may navigate backward
    /// to any point in the navigation history, which directly causes one or more ``ViewControllable`` instances to be
    /// immediately removed from the navigation stack. In these situations, to detach `Flow` instances corresponding to
    /// already dismissed ``ViewControllable`` instances, the `Context` instance will be informed of the dismissal
    /// (and be provided the ``ViewControllable`` instances) which then informs the `Flow` instance to perform
    /// the detachment only.
    ///
    /// Example of `Flow` implementation:
    /// ```swift
    /// func detach(endingFlowsFor viewControllers: [ViewControllable]) {
    ///     detach(endingFlowsOfType: ViewControllableFlow.self) { flow in
    ///         viewControllers.contains { $0 === flow.viewController }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Note: In the above example, the `where` closure returns `true` if the ``ViewControllable`` of the `flow`
    ///   exists in the given `viewControllers` array.
    ///
    /// - Important: Use the ``AbstractFlow/detach(endingSubFlowsOfType:where:)`` method only when ``ViewControllable``
    ///   instances are dismissed directly within the UI framework (before the `Context` instance is informed of the
    ///   interaction). And therefore, in normal situations, use the ``AbstractFlow/detach(ending:)`` method whenever
    ///   the `Flow` instance initiates the dismissal.
    ///
    /// Within a `UIKit` app (for example), for a `Flow` instance to be informed of view controllers removed from a
    /// navigation stack as a result of user interactions, the view controller must subclass ``NavigationController``
    /// and provide the closure in which to call the receiver method.
    ///
    /// Example of view controller implementation:
    /// ```swift
    /// class ViewController: NavigationController {
    ///
    ///     init() {
    ///         super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
    ///         onPopViewControllers { [weak self] in

    ///         }
    ///     }
    /// }
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The `Context` (receiver) instance is then responsible for forwarding the ``ViewControllable`` collection to the
    /// `Flow` instance.
    ///
    /// Example of `Context` implementation:
    /// ```swift
